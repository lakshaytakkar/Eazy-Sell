Build a professional web portal for Eazy-to-Sell that serves two audiences:

Admin (internal team):

Manage products and categories

Manage clients and their stage pipeline

Review partner “Launch Kits”

Maintain pricing settings (can be basic now)

Store Partner / Investor (external):

Browse product catalog (see landing price, suggested MRP, margin)

Build an opening inventory “Launch Kit”

Track store launch progress (simple timeline)

Use ROI estimator (simple, interactive)

We are building UI experience first with sample/mock data. Logic can be improved later.

UI COMPONENT GUIDELINES

Use a clean layout: left sidebar + top bar for logged-in areas

Cards, tables, and forms should be consistent and readable

Product cards must be “retail catalog style” with clear pricing hierarchy

Use Indian currency formatting (₹1,50,000)

Keep spacing generous; no clutter

SEED / MOCK DATA (UI ONLY)

Create sample:

10 products across categories (kitchen, stationery, toys, decor, storage, bags, bathroom, cleaning, gifts)

3 clients in different stages

1 admin user

BUILD ORDER (UI-FIRST)

Public pages + auth screens (UI only)

Client dashboard + catalog + launch kit UI

Admin dashboard + kanban + product management UI

ROI estimator UI

Polish mobile responsiveness

IMPORTANT

Do UI and navigation first. Use mock data and placeholders where needed. Keep the data model and calculation logic minimal for now, but structure the UI so it can be wired later without redesign.
